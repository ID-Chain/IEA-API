# IdentityChain Agent REST API

## Running locally

### Without Docker

#### Requirements

-   Running [Hyperledger Indy Node] Pool.

-   Running [MongoDB] instance which is used for persistence on top of
    Indy-DLT to support stateless REST API.

-   Check [Install MongoDB Community Edition] on how to install MongoDB
    on your system.

> NOTE: libindy creates a `.indy_client` directory in your home directory
> to store data. If API does not connect correctly to the pool, please
> remove this folder to allow for new configuration settings.

#### Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Config

Check `.env` file for configuration of indy-pool, host and port of API
and DB. If required add own `pool_transaction_genesis` file and change
configuration here.

### With Docker Compose

This will build and run 4 services: Indy-Pool, MongoDB, this project API and Schema Compiler from schema-api project. Not that schema-api project must be cloned to ../schema-api (sibling) folder.

#### Requirements

Please follow the instruction to install [Docker] & [Docker-Compose]

Before run docker-compose, you need to run

```bash
docker network create --subnet 172.16.0.0/24 indy-network
```

#### Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> Ports are exposed and you can also develop the API by commenting all lines
> related to the API service from the docker-compose.yml file and running
> `npm run dev`

## Running Tests

1. Run API as described in the previous section
1. Run the test using npm script:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
